                <p> HANIFA I LOVE YOU,The world might call me crazy, but I’m glad to be crazy about you! My sweetheart, I love you!

                    Loving you has become a must for me. It is no longer a choice or option.
                    
                    If there’s one thing in this world I’m afraid to lose, it’s you. I am so in love with you that I can’t afford to lose you!
                    
                    You turned my life into a journey of love and happiness. Every second I spend with you; I fall in love even more with you!
                    
                    If you ask me when I want to be with you, my answer will be – now and forever.
                    
                    No matter what has happened. No matter what you’ve done. No matter what you will do. I will always love you.
                    
                    You don’t know how blessed I am to have you in life. You have given a new meaning to my life. Love you.
                    
                    I wish to be everything that brings a smile on your face and happiness to your heart. I want to love you like no one else ever did!
                    
                    You are the reason for my smile and my happiness. I love you endlessly!
                    
                    I wrote your name in the sky, but the wind blew it away. I wrote your name in the sand, but the waves washed it away. I wrote your name in my heart, and forever it will stay.
                    
                    I am so lost in loving you that I don’t know the right words to express what I feel for you. No word can describe my love for you!
                    
                    Loving you is the best thing that I have done in my whole life. Thanks for making my life amazing.
                    
                    Every day, I thank God for sending an angel like you into my life. I love you so much.
                    
                    
                     
                    No matter what happens, I know there is one person who will be there for me. That’s you, my love.
                    
                    You are the brightest star that lights up my life every day.
                    
                    Good morning my love! Sending you lots of love and kisses.
                    
                    I have fallen in love so many times in life. But every time, it was with you!
                    
                    “For you, I may be just one person, but for me, you are the world.”
                    
                    I love you- this is the least I can say. I wish I could do more to actually show what I really feel for you.
                    
                    They say love can’t be seen; it can only be felt. But they were wrong. I have seen it many times. I have seen true love for me in your eyes. And it’s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen!
                    
                    I love you hanifa  </p>
